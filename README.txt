The Forgiving Sea is a film score for full orchestra.  It was written for 
a student film called "The Forgiving Sea", as a final project for the film 
scoring course sequence at the Pacific Northwest Film Scoring Program
(http://www.pnwfilmmusic.com), led by Hummie Mann.  The score was learned,
performed, and recorded by a volunteer orchestra as part of the final 
project.

The score was originally notated in Sibelius, and is here reproduced in 
lilypond.  The lilypond project currently includes cue 1M2, the first of
the six cues.

The composer for cue 1M2 is Curt Siffert (http://curtsiffert.com), and the 
score is offered here as a learning exercise.  The visual score is released
under a creative commons license by Curt Siffert, by-nc, and pull requests 
for lilypond revisions are welcomed.
