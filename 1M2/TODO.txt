Consider aligning last note decrescendos whether or not they have dynamics?

Vibraphone final sustain in score does not extend to fine bar.

Consider making measure number font easier to read

Pull arbitrary-bar-number from percussion part into library

Look at "relative" in notes/parts/score to see where its best place is

Rename score.ly to 1M2-Score.ly?

Consider making a "book" that has all the parts put together.

Keep in mind:

Every \layout block affects the \score or \book block in which it 
appears Ð i.e., a \layout block inside a \score block affects only 
that \score block, but a \layout block outside of a \score block 
(and thus in a \book block, either explicitly or implicitly) will 
affect every \score in that \book.

Remember that \once means it only applies to the *immediately following* 
note.  Earlier than that, and it gets ignored!!  (Also, \once can be
used before \set.)

\revert works by just not specifying the final value.

#'string is different than #string, because #'string implies that 
"string" is a SYMBOL; like a variable name.  However, something like 
#white also works, because white is a FUNCTION.

Also, it'll simply ignore an override if you specify the wrong context
for it.  Double check that is't not really a parent context that
draws it.
